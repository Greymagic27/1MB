  #How much time do players have to welcome a player to earn points? - in seconds.
  EarnPointTime: 18
  
  #What shop should the '/welcomes shop' command open if no argument is provided?

  #Should the plugin log a message in points.log file showing purchases of items and balances before/after.
  #Very useful to ensure players got their items and they aren't lying about points missing.
  ItemPurchaseLogging: true

  #How long should each player have to wait until they are marked to be earnable for a point? - in seconds.
  #At default this is 600, which means, if a player joins, and I earn a point off them, I have to wait 600 seconds
  #before I can earn another point from that player.
  PlayerJoinPointCooldown: 600
  
  #Should the default join message be changed? If so, what should it look like?
  #Leave it as 'DEFAULT' to use the default message.
  #Set it to '' to remove the message entirely.
  #If players have a custom join message enabled, that will be used instead of this.

  AssumeDefaultCommands: true
  
  #What phrases can the player use to earn points?
  #To earn a point, the player MUST use the players username, or display name (nickname) to earn a point.
  #For example: 'welcome back <player>'

    #Setting this to true will let players use nicknames or display names rather then the players set name
    #to earn points and trigger the phrases. 
    AllowNicknames: true
    
    #Enabling this will make it so, saying anything as long as it contains their name will earn them a point.

    AllPhrases: true
    
    #If you don't want to use the above setting, you can put the phrases here.
    #These will check to see if the message includes it. i.e. 'wb' will work for 'bla bla wb <player>'
