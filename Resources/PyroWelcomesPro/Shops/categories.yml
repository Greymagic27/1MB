# To make a new category, or shop, just copy this file and rename it.
#
# This is a example category shop. To make an item buyable with points, add
# 'price: <cost>' to the itemstack you want to add. 
# Not including this will mark it as a decoration instead. i.e. glass, etc.
#
# If you want to make an item open another category, i.e. sub-menu, add 
# 'category: <id>' to the itemstack you want to add it to.
#
# You do not need to include everything on each item. If you don't include it
# like in the background-black example, it will be ignored.
#
# Commands are executed through console. Not including 'permission' on an item
# will make it assume there is no permission.
